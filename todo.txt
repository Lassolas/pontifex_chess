TODO LIST

18/04/2025
- update the training phase to give color feedback.
- Mix the hard trial with simple ones to get a contrastive anlaysis, do performance decrease harder in hard task than easy ?  
- Compensate for lack of trials (IES is only computed on succesful tries, if there is only one then its max)
- Add a focus performance score. (constant focus vs decline) 
to motivate people to focus more despite being tired.
